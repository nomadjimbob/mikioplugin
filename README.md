Mikio Plugin adds a heap of layout and Bootstrap 4 elements that can be used on your [DokuWiki](http://dokuwiki.org/) pages.

This plugin can be used by itself, however is designed to complement the [Mikio DokuWiki template](http://dokuwiki.org/template:mikio).

## Updating Styles

You can update the colors used by the elements by editing the `/assets/variables.css` file. From version 2022-10-31 onwards, the theme supports darkmode within browsers.

If you have the [Mikio DokuWiki template](http://dokuwiki.org/template:mikio) 2022-10-31 onwards installed, the `/assets/variables.css` will be ignored as the template adds the variables itself. These can be edited using
**Template Style Settings** in your sites **Administration** page.

## Setting Up

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nomadjimbob/mikioplugin/releases/latest) and place it in the\
\
:file_folder: dokuwiki\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:file_folder: lib\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:file_folder: plugins

directory of your DokuWiki installation.

Sometimes GitHub releases change the name of the mikioplugin directory, so make sure that the directory is `mikioplugin` else you may see errors in DokuWiki.

## Disabling Tags

If a Mikio Plugin tag is conflicting with another plugins tag, or you want to simply disable a tag, you can do this in the `disabled-tags.php` file.

Simply change the tag you want to disable to `true` instead of `false`. Pages that have already been generated while the tag was enabled will need to be regenerated.
